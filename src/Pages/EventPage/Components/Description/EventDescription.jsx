              Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and
              computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms
              to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
              accuracy. IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its
              own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining the term, “machine
              learning” with his research (link resides outside ibm.com) around
              the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers
              master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he
              lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this
              feat seems trivial, but it’s considered a major milestone in the
              field of artificial intelligence.
